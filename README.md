# hello-world
First repository in GitHub.
This is my first time entering the computer coding world via collaborative website like GitHub. Anxious to try this out
and make it work but there's some much to learn and understand. If you have any input, advice, suggestions for this newbie, it will gladly be looked at. Thank you.
